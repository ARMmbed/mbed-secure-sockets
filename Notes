Questions:
- partial writes: either change the Sockets API or handle this on our side by
  storing a local copy of the data and doing a second write, probably in the
sent handler
- sent handler? depends on what we want to do with partial writes
- is it a good idea to require users to check the return code of close() and
  call again on WOULD_BLOCK? While the TLS spec says we must send
close_notify, in practice all peers can handle its absence. Maybe it's better
to have a simpler API here?

Changes needed/desirable in base sockets:
- add SOCKET_ERROR_TLS? The s/SOCKET_ERROR_UNKNOWN/SOCKET_ERROR_TLS/ here.
- partial write API? see above
