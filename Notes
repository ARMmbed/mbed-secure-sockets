Todo:
- sent handler?
- partial writes (needs local copy of data)
- disconnectHandler?

Changes needed/desirable in base sockets:
- add SOCKET_ERROR_TLS?

Questions already for TCPStream:
- prevent copies (private copy constructor and assign operator in the base
  class)?
- "remove" methods that don't make any sense? (send_to for TCP)?
