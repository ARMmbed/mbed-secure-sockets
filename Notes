Todo:
- sent handler? depends on what we want to do with partial writes
- partial writes: either change the Sockets API or handle this on our side by
  storing a local copy of the data and doing a second write, probably in the
sent handler

Changes needed/desirable in base sockets:
- add SOCKET_ERROR_TLS? The s/SOCKET_ERROR_UNKNOWN/SOCKET_ERROR_TLS/ here.
- partial write API? see above
